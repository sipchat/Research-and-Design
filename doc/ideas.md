ID is not enough, SI needs computation, storage, and communication.
ID is useful in social contexts. Contexts set the scope and requirements of IDs.
Not only SI, but SIâ€™s digital assets (files/data packets) should have identities.
SI requires end-to-end security.
SIS supports mobility and delay-tolerant networking where users have intermittent connectivity.
We use a two-tier model of ID -> Name -> Data. ID->name for the trust model, Name -> Data for all communication and security management.
Anonymous is easy: breaking the link of Name -> Data. Any SIS can provide such services to give any data a new name. Name and ID are immutable. NDN removes entirely the information regarding who is requesting the data.
SIS owns three types of autonomous systems: traditional personal and social apps, pervasive computing (IoT).
Because of SIS, biometric-based ID is a safe and user-friendly choice. No need to use any third party for ID recovery.
AI can help automatic operation of SIS.
